## Setup instructions

You will need Python 3.7+ to use most of the things in this repository. Once installed
create a virtual environment like this:

```bash
# create venv - only do this once
python3 -m venv .venv

# activate environment - do this every time
source .venv/bin/activate

# install packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
